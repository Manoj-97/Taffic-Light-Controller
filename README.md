# Taffic-Light-Controller
The designed controller contains 3 modules - Main which connects the remaining 2 modules, tlc which performs the traffic light management, clockdiv which delevers a real time slow clock.
The test file is use to view the simulation results.
The design was implemented using a simple FSM and implemented in a Xilinx Spartan 3E FPGA kit.
